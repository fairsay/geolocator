The geolocator library provides a common interface to location-related data from various sources and provides means to calculate distances between places. Currently the MaxMind country & city geoip data sources are supported. There is also some preliminary support for using GNS (GEOnet Names Server )data. For distance calculation, the Haversine function is used.

The library can be useful for example to implement location-based features in different www frameworks; for an example of that, see the GeoLocation Zope / CMF / Plone package from which this library was spun off. Please note, however, that there is nothing www-specific in the library, nor does it have any external dependencies.

If you use this library, please send me email; I would like to add links to the package home page to point to other software using this library.
